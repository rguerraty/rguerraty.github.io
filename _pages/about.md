I am a Chilean physicist specializing in cosmology.

I received my BSc in Applied Physics from Universidad de Santiago. I then completed my PhD in Physics at Universidad de Chile, during which I spent one year as a PhD guest at the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. After completing my PhD, I was awarded a Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship for a postdoctoral position at the Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics Group of the University of Geneva, where I also joined CERN's Theoretical Physics Department as an associate member. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile, funded by the Chilean National Research and Development Agency (ANID).


Throughout my research career, I have also been involved in teaching activities and have served as a referee for *Annals of Physics*.

Outside of physics you can find me in the mountains, either on my bike or hiking. I am an amateur mountain biker in the disciplines of enduro and downhill. Earlier this year (2024), I placed 4th in the *Master A experience* category during the second round of the Chilean National Enduro Championship.
