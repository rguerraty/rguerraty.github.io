I am a Chilean physicist specializing in cosmology.

I received my BSc in Applied Physics from Universidad de Santiago, where, as an undergraduate, I began doing research in mathematical physics and supersymmetric quantum mechanics under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://fisica.postgrado.usach.cl/en/mikhail-plyushchay" style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: black; color: black;">Mikhail Plyushchay</a>.

For my graduate studies, I moved to Universidad de Chile, where I specialized in early universe cosmology and defended my PhD thesis, <a href="https://repositorio.uchile.cl/handle/2250/181845" style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: black; color: black;">*"The role of primordial symmetries in the determination of the non-gaussian properties of our universe,"*</a> under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://portafolio-academico.uchile.cl/perfil/46164-Gonzalo-Alejandro-Palma-Quilodrán" style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: black; color: black;">Gonzalo Palma</a>. As part of my PhD, I spent one year as a guest researcher at the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, invited by Professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Achúcarro" style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: black; color: black;">Ana Achúcarro</a>.

After completing my PhD, I was awarded a <a href="https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home/education/scholarships-and-grants/swiss-government-excellence-scholarships.html" style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: black; color: black;">Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship</a> to develop the project *“Primordial Black Holes: A Window to the Primordial Universe Through Gravitational Waves”* as a postdoctoral researcher with the Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics Group at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, hosted by Professor <a href="https://www.istitutoveneto.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/1869" style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: black; color: black;">Antonio Riotto</a>. During this time, I worked on topics related to the production of primordial black holes and gravitational waves in cosmology. Additionally, I joined CERN’s Theoretical Physics Department as an associate member.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, hosted by Professor <a href="https://fisica.uc.cl/en/academico/maximo-banados-2/" style="text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-color: black; color: black;">Máximo Bañados</a>. My research focuses on developing the project *"Testing the Primordial Signals of our Universe"*, funded by the FONDECYT Postdoc initiative of the Chilean National Research and Development Agency (ANID).


Throughout my research career, I have also been involved in teaching activities and have served as a referee for *Annals of Physics*.


Outside of physics you can find me in the mountains, either on my bike or hiking. I am an amateur mountain biker in the disciplines of enduro and downhill. Earlier this year (2024), I placed 4th in the *Master A experience* category during the second round of the Chilean National Enduro Championship.
