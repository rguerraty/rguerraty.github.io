I received my BSc in Applied Physics from Universidad de Santiago de Chile. I then completed my PhD in Physics at Universidad de Chile, during which I spent one year as a PhD guest at the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. After completing my PhD, I was awarded a Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship to pursue a Postdoc at the University of Geneva, where I also joined CERN as an associate member. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile, funded by the Chilean National Research Agency (ANID).

I also have teaching experience and serving as a peer reviewer for Annals of Physics.
