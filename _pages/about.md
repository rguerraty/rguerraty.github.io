I am a Chilean physicist working in cosmology.

I received my BSc in Applied Physics from Universidad de Santiago de Chile. I then completed my PhD in Physics at Universidad de Chile, during which I spent one year as a PhD guest at the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. After completing my PhD, I was awarded a Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship to pursue a Postdoc at the University of Geneva, where I also joined CERN's Theoretical Physics Department as an Associate Member. I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile, funded by the Chilean National Research and Development Agency (ANID).


Throughout my research career, I have also been involved in teaching activities and have served as a referee for Annals of Physics.

Outside of physics, I am an enthusiastic mountain biker, focused on Enduro and Downhill disciplines. Earlier this year (2024), I placed 4th in the Master A experience category during the second round of the Chilean National Enduro Championship.
