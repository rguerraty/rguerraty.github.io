I am a Chilean physicist specializing in cosmology.

I received my BSc in Applied Physics from Universidad de Santiago, where, as an undergraduate, I began conducting research in mathematical physics and supersymmetric quantum mechanics under the supervision of Professor Mikhail Plyushchay.

For my graduate studies, I moved to Universidad de Chile, where I specialized in early universe cosmology and completed my PhD thesis on topics related to cosmic inflation under the supervision of Professor Gonzalo Palma. As part of my PhD, I spent one year as a guest researcher at the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, invited by Professor Ana Achúcarro.

After completing my PhD, I was awarded a Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship to undertake a postdoctoral position with the Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics Group at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, hosted by Professor Antonio Riotto. During this period, I focused on topics related to the production of primordial black holes and gravitational waves in cosmology. Additionally, I joined CERN’s Theoretical Physics Department as an associate member.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, hosted by Professor Máximo Bañados. My research focuses on developing the project *"Testing the Primordial Signals of our Universe"*, funded by the FONDECYT Postdoc initiative of the Chilean National Research and Development Agency (ANID).


Throughout my research career, I have also been involved in teaching activities and have served as a referee for *Annals of Physics*.


Outside of physics you can find me in the mountains, either on my bike or hiking. I am an amateur mountain biker in the disciplines of enduro and downhill. Earlier this year (2024), I placed 4th in the *Master A experience* category during the second round of the Chilean National Enduro Championship.
