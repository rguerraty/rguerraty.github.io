I am a Chilean physicist working in cosmology.

I received my BSc in Applied Physics from Universidad de Santiago, where, as an undergraduate, I began doing research in mathematical physics, integrable systems and supersymmetric quantum mechanics under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://fisica.postgrado.usach.cl/en/mikhail-plyushchay" style="color: #6f99b0; text-decoration: none;">Mikhail Plyushchay</a>.

For my graduate studies, I moved to Universidad de Chile, where I specialized in early universe cosmology and defended my PhD thesis, <a href="https://repositorio.uchile.cl/handle/2250/181845" style="color: #6f99b0; text-decoration: none;">*"The role of primordial symmetries in the determination of the non-gaussian properties of our universe"*</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://portafolio-academico.uchile.cl/perfil/46164-Gonzalo-Alejandro-Palma-Quilodrán" style="color: #6f99b0; text-decoration: none;">Gonzalo Palma</a>. As part of my PhD, I spent one year as a guest researcher at the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, invited by Professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_Achúcarro" style="color: #6f99b0; text-decoration: none;">Ana Achúcarro</a>.

After completing my PhD, I was awarded a <a href="https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home/education/scholarships-and-grants/swiss-government-excellence-scholarships.html" style="color: #6f99b0; text-decoration: none;">Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship</a> to develop the project *“Primordial Black Holes: A Window to the Primordial Universe Through Gravitational Waves”* as a postdoctoral researcher with the Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics Group at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, hosted by Professor <a href="https://www.istitutoveneto.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/1869" style="color: #6f99b0; text-decoration: none;">Antonio Riotto</a>. During this time, I worked on topics related to the production of primordial black holes and gravitational waves in the early universe. During my stay in Geneva, I also joined CERN’s Theoretical Physics Department as an associate member.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, hosted by Professor <a href="https://fisica.uc.cl/en/academico/maximo-banados-2/" style="color: #6f99b0; text-decoration: none;">Máximo Bañados</a>, where I am developing the project *"Testing the Primordial Signals of our Universe"*, funded by the FONDECYT Postdoc initiative of the Chilean National Research and Development Agency (ANID).


Throughout my research career, I have also been involved in teaching activities and have served as a referee for *Annals of Physics*.


Outside of physics, you can find me in the mountains, either on my bike or hiking <a href="/assets/images/bike.jpeg" data-lightbox="image-set" data-title="Flying on my bike at Cerro San Cristobal in Santiago"><i class="fa-regular fa-images" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #6f99b0; font-size: 20px;"></i></a><a href="/assets/images/pintor.jpeg" data-lightbox="image-set" data-title="Summit of Cerro Pintor at 4180 MASL. In the background you can see Cerro el Plomo (5424 MASL)"></a>. I am an amateur mountain biker in the disciplines of enduro and downhill. Early last year (2024), I got a 4th place in the second round of the Chilean National Enduro Championship, *Enduroseries*.
