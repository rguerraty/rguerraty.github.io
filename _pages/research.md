I am a theoretical physicist specializing in various aspects of high-energy physics and gravity, working at the intersection of particle physics, quantum field theory, general relativity, and cosmology. 

My main scientific goal lies in developing theoretical methods to test fundamental physics in phenomenological setups such as cosmology and gravitational waves. 

I am currently focused on understanding the symmetries of genuine non-linear perturbations in the simplest models of cosmic inflation and exploring how these connect to observables in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the galaxy distribution in the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe, and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), as well as their potential impact on the production of primordial black holes. I am also working on how fundamental principles such as locality, unitarity, and causality can theoretically constrain our current models of cosmological perturbations, allowing us to compare them with cosmological data.
